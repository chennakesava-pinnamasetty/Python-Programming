# Reasons We Use Comments:

# 1. Explain Code -- Make it easier to others ( or your future self ) to understand what the code does.
# 2. Improve Readability -- Breaks complex code into understandable sections.
# 3. Debugging -- Temporarily disable parts of code without deleting them.
# 4.  Collaboration -- Helps team members understand each other’s code in projects.



# Types of Comments in Python

# 1. Single-line comment → starts with #
               
print("Hello World ")
# print("Hello Chenna")  --> This is a single-line comment

# 2. Multi-line comment → uses triple quotes (''' or """)
       
'''x = 5
y = "John"             
print(x)            This is a multi-line comment. It can span multiple lines.
print(y)'''
