# What is Indentation ?

    # Indentation meas adding spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line to show block structure ( like inside if, for , whike , def , ect.).

# In python, Indentation is not optional -- it is required to define the structure of the code.



# Examples :

if 10 > 8:
    print(" 10 is grater than 8")  # this is correct 


if 10 > 8:
print(" 10 is grater than 8")      # this code get error, Because there is no indentation
                                   # Will give IndentationError
 



# Rules to Remeber

   # Always use same number of spaces ( usually 4).
   # Don't mix tabs and spaces - is causes error.
   # Every new block ( after if, for, def, etc.) must be indented.
